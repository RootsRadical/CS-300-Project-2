# CS-300-Project-2
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
-For this project we were creating an application for a client that would aide advisors in assisting students selecting classes.
-The app would take a course code or class name and provide any potential prerequisites and sort them numerically. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
-First we started by creating psuedocode for the application. Within that assingment we had to select what kind of data structure we wanted to implement.
-We had to consider things like searching speed, sorting ability, & ease of coding it.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
-I met all of the roadblocks head on. I made sure to have my textbooks open and available. When I wasn't finding the answers needed I would utilize google too.
-When I was really struggling, I leaned on experienced programmers that are working in the field. 
-They have been really encouraging and have tried to help me learn when they could. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
-This project has really made me consider different ways using data structures. I never really new about Binary Trees vs vectors etc.
-It is definitely a lot to consider as you're in the planning phases of the applicaiton.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
-Adding in these new elements has made me consider what is the most streamlined way of coding these different requirements.
-Chunking up the different pieces into smaller more obtainable goals was my friend for this project.
